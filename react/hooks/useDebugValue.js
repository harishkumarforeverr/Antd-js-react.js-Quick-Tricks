// `useDebugValue` is a React Hook that allows you to provide additional debugging information about a value while developing your React components. It is primarily used to display custom labels for hooks in React DevTools, making it easier to identify and understand the purpose of each hook in your code.

// A simple example would be a custom hook called `useCounter` that increments a counter value:

// ```jsx
import { useState, useEffect, useDebugValue } from "react";

const useCounter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Some side effect that depends on the counter value
    document.title = `Count: ${count}`;

    // Update the debug value with a custom label
    useDebugValue(`Counter: ${count}`);
  }, [count]);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
  };

  return { count, increment };
};

const CounterComponent = () => {
  const { count, increment } = useCounter();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};
// ```

// In this example, `useDebugValue` is used to display a custom label in React DevTools for the `useCounter` hook. The label is set to `"Counter: ${count}"`, which means the current value of the counter will be displayed alongside the hook's label in the DevTools. This can be helpful in debugging and understanding the state of the hook during development.

// Note that `useDebugValue` has no effect on the actual functionality of the code and is solely used for debugging purposes.
