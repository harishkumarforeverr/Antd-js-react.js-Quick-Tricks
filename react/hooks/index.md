I apologize for the confusion. I made an error in my previous response. The "useArray" hook is not an official hook provided by React. It seems that I included some hooks in the list that are not part of the official React hooks API. I apologize for any confusion caused.

To clarify, the official React hooks are:

1. useState
2. useEffect
3. useContext
4. useReducer
5. useMemo
6. useCallback
7. useRef
8. useImperativeHandle
9. useLayoutEffect
10. useDebugValue

Again, I apologize for the mistake and any confusion it may have caused.
