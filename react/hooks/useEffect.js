// `useEffect` is a hook in React that allows you to perform side effects in functional components. Side effects are actions that are performed outside of the normal component rendering process, such as fetching data from an API, subscribing to events, or manipulating the DOM. 

// The `useEffect` hook takes two arguments: a function and a dependency array. The function passed to `useEffect` is called after every render of the component. The dependency array is optional and it specifies which values the effect depends on. If any of the values in the dependency array change, the effect will be re-run. If the dependency array is omitted, the effect will be run after every render.

// Here's a simple real-time example to illustrate the usage of `useEffect`:

// ```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const Timer = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const timerId = setInterval(() => {
      setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
    }, 1000);

    return () => {
      clearInterval(timerId);
    };
  }, []);

  return <div>{count}</div>;
};

export default Timer;
// ```

// In this example, we have a `Timer` component that displays a count that increments every second. We use `useState` to create a state variable `count` and a function `setCount` to update its value. 

// Inside the `useEffect` hook, we set up an interval using `setInterval` that increments the count every second and updates the state using `setCount`. We also return a cleanup function that clears the interval using `clearInterval` when the component is unmounted or when the dependency array is updated.

// By passing an empty dependency array `[]`, we ensure that the effect only runs once, when the component is mounted. This ensures that the interval is set up and cleaned up correctly.

// Overall, this example demonstrates how `useEffect` can be used to perform side effects and manage their lifecycle in a functional component.
