// In React, `useRef` is a hook that provides a way to access and manipulate a mutable value that persists across component renders. It allows you to create a reference to a particular element or value and maintain that reference throughout the component's lifecycle.

// A simple real-time example where `useRef` can be useful is implementing focus management in a form. Let's say you have a form with multiple input fields, and you want to automatically focus on the next input field when the user finishes typing in the current one. Here's how you can achieve this using `useRef`:

// ```jsx
import React, { useRef } from "react";

function Form() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  const handleInputChange = () => {
    // Perform any necessary logic here

    // Focus on the next input field
    inputRef.current.focus();
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input ref={inputRef} onChange={handleInputChange} />
      <input ref={inputRef} onChange={handleInputChange} />
      <input ref={inputRef} onChange={handleInputChange} />
    </div>
  );
}
// ```

// In this example, we create a `ref` using `useRef` and assign it to the `inputRef` variable. Each input field uses the same `inputRef` to reference itself. When the `onChange` event is triggered in any input field, the `handleInputChange` function is called. Inside that function, you can perform any desired logic, and then the `focus` method is called on `inputRef.current` to move the focus to the next input field.

// By using `useRef`, we can persist the reference to the current input field across renders, enabling us to manipulate it as needed. This is just one example of how `useRef` can be used, and it can be applied to various scenarios where you need to maintain a reference to an element or value in a React component.
