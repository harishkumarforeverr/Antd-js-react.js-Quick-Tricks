# hr interview questions

Sure, here are some common HR questions for a software developer with 4-5 years of experience, along with sample answers:

1. **Introduction about self with family,location,education,technical expirience**

   "I have a total of 4.4 years of experience as a software developer. I've spent 3 years working with React.js. Additionally, I have 4.4 years of experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In the past year, I've also gained 1 year of experience in Node.js, used for server-side development in my previous met life project.

   my role and responsibilites is, I attend client meetings and ensure that our projects follow an agile approach that is sprint planning and attending daily scrum calls and delivering high-quality code to the client without errors or bugs. My responsibilities also involve API integration and state management using Redux to maintain a bug-free project."
3. **Why you left your organization - give proper professional reason**

   - I left my previous organization to pursue new challenges and opportunities in my career.(say somthing like im interest in the company and the company is the branch in the market)
4. **Tell me about your projects - like languages used how much expirience with ..**
   We have successfully developed two projects: a user app project and an admin project. In the user app project, users can conveniently book rooms by accessing detailed information about each room. Additionally, they can view and manage their personal information, including health-related details. To enhance the user experience, we integrated Google Maps for location-based services. The implementation of React, Redux, ES6, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS ensured a robust and efficient development process.

   Moving on to the admin project, it offers administrative functionalities to manage room bookings. Admins have the authority to accept or reject user requests based on room availability. With this feature, the system ensures that only available rooms are booked, preventing any conflicts or double bookings.

   Both projects were built using cutting-edge technologies and programming languages such as React, Redux, ES6, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. These technologies empowered us to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces, delivering an exceptional user experience.

   The integration of Google Maps not only improved the usability of the user app project but also provided administrators with geolocation services for efficient management of room bookings. Overall, these projects offer a seamless experience for users and administrators alike, providing a comprehensive solution for booking and managing room reservations.

   if hr ask again few more question,

   NOTE :
   `useMemo`: Memoizes the result of a function, preventing unnecessary recalculations in React components.
