# how to kill 5000 port on the terminal in windows


To kill the process using port 5000 on the terminal in Windows, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the command prompt: Press the Windows key, type "Command Prompt," and press Enter. Alternatively, you can use the shortcut Win + R, type "cmd," and hit Enter.

2. Identify the process using port 5000: Run the following command to find the process ID (PID) associated with port 5000:
   ```
   netstat -ano | findstr :5000
   ```

   This command will list the processes with their corresponding PIDs that are using port 5000. Make a note of the PID number.

3. Terminate the process: Run the following command, replacing `<PID>` with the actual process ID you obtained in the previous step:
   ```
   taskkill /F /PID <PID>
   ```

   The `/F` flag forces the termination of the process, and `/PID <PID>` specifies the process ID to be killed.

After executing the command, the process using port 5000 should be terminated, freeing up the port for future use. You can now start your application or server on port 5000 without any conflicts.

Based on the output you provided, the process with PID 17776 is using port 5000. To kill that process and free up the port, you can use the following command in the Windows Command Prompt:

```
taskkill /F /PID 17776
```

Executing this command will forcefully terminate the process associated with the given PID, releasing port 5000. Once the process is terminated, you should be able to use port 5000 for your application or server.
